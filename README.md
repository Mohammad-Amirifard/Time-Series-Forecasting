# Project Detail

**Problem**: Time Series Forecasting

**Goal**: The task is to develop a forecasting model that is able to predict several uncorrelated time series. The prerequisite is that the model exhibits generalisation capabilities in the forecasting domain, allowing it to transcend the constraints of specific time domains. This requires a model that, while specialised in forecasting, is not limited to predicting in a single or predefined time context.
